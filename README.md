## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices 

## This project uses the boston data to train a Machine Learning model using supervised learning technique and then predicts the price for a new dataset.

### Installation

**Windows/Mac/Linux:** To view this project on a computer, you don't need anything installed. The jupyter notebook(.ipynb) file can be displayed easily just by clicking on it.

**Mobile:** To view this on a mobile, you will need a browser that supports desktop site(eg: chrome). Open the browser and switch to desktop mode and click on the file. It should work just fine.

This project uses **Python 2.7** and the following libraries.

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


### Data

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Predicting-Boston-Housing-Prices/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
